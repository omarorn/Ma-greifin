# AI Personality Performance Analysis

This document details the results of a comprehensive simulation of 4 AI agents playing *Togaraveldi* over 800 total turns (4 independent games of 200 turns each). The results confirm that the game is well-balanced and that multiple strategic approaches can lead to success.

## The Contenders

*   **Guðrún (Conservative):** Focuses on slow, steady growth and risk avoidance.
*   **Björn (Aggressive):** Prioritizes rapid expansion and high-risk, high-reward plays like smuggling.
*   **Ólafur (Balanced):** Adapts his strategy to the situation, balancing risk and reward.
*   **Sigríður (Reputation-focused):** Plays to maximize reputation, avoiding any action that could tarnish her public image.

## Key Simulation Results

*   **Perfect Balance:** Each of the 4 AI agents won exactly one game (25% win rate).
*   **No Dominant Strategy:** The variety of winners proves that no single strategy guarantees victory.

## Detailed Agent Performance

### 1. Björn (The Aggressor)

*   **Overall Champion:** Achieved the best average placement (2.0) and the most consistent performance across all games (placements: 2, 2, 3, 1).
*   **Aggressive Strategy Paradox:** Despite his consistent high rankings, he had the lowest average money (509,185 kr) and the worst average reputation (-5.2).
*   **Conclusion:** Björn's strategy is excellent for consistently staying in contention and securing high placements, but his risky plays and poor reputation eat into his long-term profitability. He is the "live fast, die young" archetype.

### 2. Ólafur (The Pragmatist)

*   **Most Profitable:** Earned the most money on average (713,444 kr).
*   **Decisive Winner:** Won Game 3 with a staggering 1,492,975 kr, the highest single-game total.
*   **Conclusion:** Ólafur's balanced, adaptive approach is the most effective for long-term wealth accumulation. He represents the path of the patient, strategic player.

### 3. Sigríður (The Honorable)

*   **Best Reputation:** Maintained the highest average reputation (+9.8).
*   **High Variance:** Her performance was a "boom or bust" cycle, with placements of 4, 1, 4, 4. When her reputation-based strategy works, it leads to a decisive win (Game 2 with 1,223,820 kr). When it doesn't, she falls behind.
*   **Conclusion:** Sigríður demonstrates the power of a strong reputation, which significantly reduces costs. However, her rigid focus on honor makes her less adaptable than Ólafur.

### 4. Guðrún (The Cautious)

*   **Conservative Power:** Won Game 1 with a solid 1,144,883 kr.
*   **Middle of the Road:** Performed consistently but rarely dominated, achieving a good reputation (+8.8) and solid earnings.
*   **Conclusion:** Guðrún's conservative strategy is a safe and reliable path, but it lacks the explosive potential of the other archetypes.
