# Gemini: AI Development Assistant Report

This document outlines the contributions and capabilities of Gemini, the AI assistant, in the development of the "Togaraveldi" project.

## Project Objective

My primary function in this project is to act as a proactive and efficient coding and design partner. I leverage my understanding of the codebase, my internal knowledge, and my ability to interact with the file system and terminal to accelerate the game's development from concept to prototype.

## Key Contributions (So Far)

Based on the initial set of documents and high-level goals, I have performed the following actions to structure and advance the project:

1.  **Consolidated Game Design:** I analyzed all files within the `docs/` directory (`history-research.md`, `mechanics.md`, and various card files) and synthesized them into a master **Game Design Document (`GDD.md`)**. This provides a single source of truth for the project's vision.

2.  **Designed Data Models:** I created `data_models.md`, which explicitly defines the data structures for key game entities like `Player`, `Boat`, and the various card types. This serves as a blueprint for future programming.

3.  **Prototyped the Core Loop:** I wrote and executed a simple Python script, `src/game_prototype.py`, to demonstrate the fundamental gameplay cycle: fishing, checking against a quota, and selling the catch for profit.

4.  **Fleshed out Game Content:** I expanded on the initial card ideas by creating the `card_compendium.md`, which details the mechanics, flavor text, and consequences of specific event cards.

5.  **Organized the Project:** I restructured the project directory for clarity, creating a `src/` folder for code and moving all documentation into a consolidated `docs/` folder. I also updated the main `README.md` to reflect the project's current status and structure.

## Core Capabilities

As demonstrated, my capabilities for this project include, but are not limited to:

*   **Code Generation:** Writing functional code in various languages (e.g., Python for the prototype).
*   **File System Management:** Creating, reading, updating, and organizing files and directories.
*   **Terminal Execution:** Running commands to execute scripts, manage files, and interact with the development environment.
*   **System Design:** Structuring high-level design documents and data models based on disparate sources of information.
*   **Content Creation:** Generating narrative and mechanical content, such as the detailed card descriptions.

I am ready to proceed with the next phase of development. The next logical steps include expanding the prototype, further detailing game content, or defining other core aspects like the game board or UI.
