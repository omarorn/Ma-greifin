Below is a concrete, production-oriented concept for a **Fishing Trawler Tycoon** game grounded in **Icelandic fisheries**, designed so it can realistically be built and expanded.

---

## Working Title

**Togaraveldi: Íslensk Sjávarútgerð**

---

## Core Fantasy

You are an Icelandic fishing entrepreneur starting with a single aging boat and a dream. You build a fleet, manage quotas, crews, weather, ports, politics, and technology—trying to survive storms, markets, and regulations while growing an empire.

---

## Core Game Loop

1. **Plan a trip**

   * Choose boat
   * Assign crew
   * Select fishing grounds
   * Allocate quota
2. **Go fishing**

   * Weather + sea conditions
   * Gear efficiency
   * Crew skill + fatigue
3. **Land catch**

   * Choose harbor (Vestmannaeyjar, Reykjavík, Ísafjörður, Akureyri…)
   * Fresh market vs freezing vs processing
4. **Sell & invest**

   * Fish market prices fluctuate
   * Upgrade boats, buy quota, train crew
5. **Progress**

   * Unlock bigger vessels, tech, regions, politics

---

## Setting & Authentic Icelandic Flavor

This is what makes it unique.

### Boats (Real Types)

* **Smábátar** – line & handline boats
* **Bátar** – coastal trawlers
* **Togarar** – freezer trawlers
* **Verksmiðjuskip** – floating factories (late game)

Each boat has:

* Year built (old boats break more)
* Engine type
* Gear (net, line, pelagic, demersal)
* Ice/freezing capacity

---

## Fish Species (Iceland-Specific)

* Þorskur (Cod)
* Ýsa (Haddock)
* Ufsi (Saithe)
* Karfi (Redfish)
* Grálúða (Greenland halibut)
* Síld & Loðna (pelagic, seasonal)

Each has:

* Seasonal availability
* Market demand
* Quota restrictions
* Processing value chains

---

## Quota System (Key Gameplay Depth)

* ITQ system (buy, sell, lease)
* Political events can change rules
* Overfishing penalties
* Inspection risk

This alone differentiates the game from generic tycoon sims.

---

## Crew Management

Crew are individuals, not stats.

Attributes:

* Experience
* Morale
* Fatigue
* Alcohol problems (yes, realistically optional)
* Loyalty

Events:

* Crew injury
* Walkouts
* Legendary skippers
* Family ties in ports

---

## Weather & Sea

Dynamic North Atlantic conditions:

* Storm systems
* Ice years
* Fog
* Engine failure in bad weather

Weather matters more than in most tycoon games.

---

## Ports & Regions

Each port has advantages:

* Vestmannaeyjar → pelagic strength
* Ísafjörður → long trips, ice fishing
* Reykjavík → markets & politics
* Akureyri → research & innovation

Ports can be upgraded.

---

## Economy & Politics Layer (Mid/Late Game)

* Fuel prices
* EU negotiations
* Environmental pressure
* Strikes
* Export tariffs
* Media scandals

You’re not just running boats—you’re navigating Icelandic society.

---

## Progression Phases

**Early game**

* One boat
* Loans
* Barely surviving

**Mid game**

* Fleet management
* Quota trading
* Processing plants

**Late game**

* Vertical integration
* Factory ships
* Political influence
* Global markets

---

## Visual Style (Recommended)

* Isometric or top-down
* Muted Nordic palette
* Harbors full of life
* Weather as a visual feature

---

## Platform Strategy

* **PC first** (Steam)
* Controller-friendly UI
* Mod support later (custom boats, ports, scenarios)

---

## Unique Selling Points

* Real Icelandic quota system
* Authentic boats & fish
* Harsh weather realism
* Deep crew simulation
* Cultural accuracy

This is **not** “Fishing Simulator.”
It’s **Capitalism meets North Atlantic survival**.

---

## Next Concrete Steps (If You Want)

I can:

1. Create a **GDD (Game Design Document)**
2. Design the **data models** (boats, fish, quotas)
3. Propose a **tech stack** (Unity vs Godot vs Unreal)
4. Prototype the **core loop in code**
5. Design a **vertical slice scenario** (e.g. Vestmannaeyjar, 1985)

Tell me which one to do first.
