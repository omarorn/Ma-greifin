## 💸 VERÐBÓLGA (Inflation) - Core Mechanic

**Essential to any Icelandic business game!**

Iceland has a famous history of high inflation rates throughout the 20th century.

### Automatic Annual Inflation:

Inflation is applied **every year** based on historical periods:

- **1950-1969:** Moderate (~6%) - Post-war boom
- **1970-1989:** **HIGH! (~42%)** - The inflation decades! 🔥
- **1990-2007:** Moderate (~4%) - Modern stability
- **2008-2011:** Spike (~16%) - Post-crash crisis
- **2012-2020:** Low (~3%) - Recovery

### Effects:
- ✅ Fish prices increase
- ❌ Boat upkeep costs increase
- ✅ Debt becomes easier to pay (good for debtors!)
- ❌ Cash loses value over time
- 📊 Cumulative inflation tracked since 1900

### Special Crisis Events:
