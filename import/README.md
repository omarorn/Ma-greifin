# Togaraveldi

**A game of fishing, finance, and political power in 1980s Iceland.**

---

## The Story

The year is 1984. Your family's name, once respected in the fishing towns of Iceland, is in ruins. You have one boat, a small crew, and a burning desire to restore your honor. You must rebuild your family's fishing empire, navigate the treacherous waters of Icelandic politics, and ultimately, seize power by orchestrating the election of the nation's president.

This is a game about the rise of the "Togaraveldi"—the fishing barons who held immense power in 20th-century Iceland. It is a story of wealth, corruption, and the forging of a dynasty.

## How to Play

Run the game from your terminal using Python:

```bash
python src/game.py
```

You will be presented with a menu of actions each turn. The game is played by entering the number corresponding to your desired action.

## Core Mechanics

*   **Fishing & Selling:** The foundation of your empire. Go fishing to fill your hold, then sell your catch at the market. Prices fluctuate, so time your sales wisely.
*   **Crew Management:** Your crew are individuals with their own loyalty and greed. Low morale can lead to skimming, where your crew secretly takes a larger share of the profits. You can investigate your crew, but this can further damage morale.
*   **Fame & Reputation:** `Fame` is your public notoriety. `Reputation` is your honorable standing. Fame can be a powerful tool, but a high reputation will earn you the trust of the establishment.
*   **Investments:** Buy government bonds ("Ríkisskuldabréf") to earn a steady, reliable income and boost your reputation.
*   **Suspicion & Tax Investigations:** The more money you make, the more the government will watch you. If your `Suspicion Score` gets too high, your assets will be frozen, and you will face a crippling fine.
*   **Political Capital (`Klíkusambönd`):** The ultimate currency. Spend your money and fame to support political candidates and build your hidden political influence.

## How to Win

The game is won by achieving **"Uppreisn Æru"** (The Restoration of Honor).

Every four years, a presidential election is held. If you have amassed enough `Klíkusambönd` (100 is the target), you will have the opportunity to cash in your political capital, install your chosen candidate as the President of Iceland, and win the game.

## Strategic Insights (from AI Simulations)

Extensive AI simulations have revealed that there is no single path to victory. Different strategies can succeed depending on the circumstances.

*   **The Aggressor (Björn's Strategy):** Focus on rapid expansion and high-risk plays. This is a path to consistent high rankings, but it can be costly in the long run.
*   **The Pragmatist (Ólafur's Strategy):** Adapt to the market, balance risk and reward, and focus on long-term value. This is the path to maximum profitability.
*   **The Honorable (Sigríður's Strategy):** Play to maximize reputation and avoid scandal. A high reputation reduces costs and opens doors, but it requires a more conservative playstyle.

Choose your path, captain. Your dynasty awaits.
