## 🎨 Game Philosophy

The complete philosophy is woven throughout:

### Settlement Philosophy (Intro Screen):
```
'Iceland was built by outcasts - Flóki, Ingólfur Arnarson.'
'They rejected the old world and built something new.'

'One only child can have 100 descendants.'
'A family of three can have none.'

'The age of the individual is over.'
'The age of the dynasty has begun.'
```

### Core Principles:
1. **"Iceland Was Built By Outcasts"**
   - Flóki and Ingólfur Arnarson fled Norway
   - Built something new from nothing
   - The outcasts won!

2. **"One Only Child Can Have 100 Descendants"**
   - Dynasty paradox: continuity > quantity
   - Proper succession = immortality
   - Family of 3 without heir = extinction

3. **"The Age of the Dynasty Has Begun"**
   - Multi-generational gameplay
   - Death is not the end (if you plan)
   - Legacy through succession

4. **"Crime Pays Over Real"** (underlying)
   - Klíkusambönð reduces disaster losses
   - Political capital matters
   - Moral tension through mechanics

5. **"The Ancestors Watch Over Iceland"**
   - Björn and Ragnar guide the worthy
   - Legendary Vikings bless your dynasty
   - Honor the old ways

## 📊 Game Mechanics Summary

### Turn Structure:
1. Display player status
2. Dynasty warnings (if health low, no heir)
3. Random events check (ancestors, conspiracies)
4. Player/AI decision (fish, heir, doctor)
5. Process fishing trip
6. Advance to next player
7. Monthly updates (health degradation)
8. Annual updates (inflation, historical events)

### Death & Succession:
1. **If No Heir:**
   - Dynasty ends
   - Player removed
   - GAME OVER

2. **If Heir Exists:**
   - Calculate 20% inheritance tax
   - Generate heir name (II, III, IV, Gen X)
   - Reset: health 100, B12 100, reputation 50
   - Preserve: wealth (after tax), boats, generation+1
   - Continue playing as heir!

### AI Behavior:
- Secure heir if: money > 84k, health < 40, no heir
- Visit doctor if: health < 30, money > 8.4k
- Otherwise: go fishing
- Makes AI competitive but beatable

## 💭 Philosophy In Action

### "Iceland Was Built By Outcasts"
- Game starts 1900 (early Iceland)
- References Flóki and Ingólfur in intro
- You build empire from nothing
- Ancestors (Björn, Ragnar) guide you

### "One Child Can Have 100 Descendants"
- Secure ONE proper heir = dynasty continues
- Three children without designated heir = extinction
- Continuity > quantity
- Succession conflicts teach this lesson

### "Crime Pays Over Real"
- Klíkusambönð reduces disaster losses
- Political capital matters (Ragnar gives this!)
- Legitimate vs cunning paths

### "The Age of the Dynasty"
- Multi-generational gameplay (Name → II → III → IV)
- Death with heir = succession, game continues
- Build something that outlasts you
- Legacy through proper planning
